What does it do?
----------------

The target of this project is an out-of-the-box solution for TYPO3 frontend user management. I'm tired using newloginbox and sr\_fe\_userregister with all the bugs and problems.

This first release contains a replacement for newloginbox. These are the main features:

-   Login and Logout with predefined redirect pages
-   No more problems with IE password storage
-   Full featured HTML-Templates. You can output any feuser data you want.
-   Possible login with email address
-   Login from the backend module with any FE user for debugging purposes

The extensions contains also a set of useful classes for other extensions. So sometimes you need to install this extension without to use the plugin.
